# see: http://askubuntu.com/questions/145443/how-do-i-use-pm-suspend-hybrid-by-default-instead-of-pm-suspend
#
# WORKAROUND: always set the default hibernate mode first (normal mode)
# (not required if you have the patch mentioned by Rohan below (http://askubuntu.com/a/344879/169))
HIBERNATE_MODE=platform

# Always use hibernate instead of suspend, but with "suspend to both"
if [ "$METHOD" = "suspend" ]; then
  METHOD=hibernate
  HIBERNATE_MODE=suspend
fi

# Make sure to use the kernel's method, in case uswsusp is installed etc.
SLEEP_MODULE=kernel
